                <p>2.2 The Order shall be deemed accepted on the earlier of:<br>
                    (a) the Supplier issuing written acceptance of the Order; or<br>
                    (b) any act by the Supplier consistent with fulfilling the Order, at which point and on which date the Contract shall come into existence (Commencement Date).</p>

                <p>2.3 These Conditions apply to the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms that the Supplier seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, 
                    practice or course of dealing.</p>

                <p>2.4 All of these Conditions shall apply to the supply of both Goods and Services except where the application to one or the other is specified.</p>

            <!-- 3 -->
            <h3 id="three">3. Supply of goods</h3>

                <p>3.1 The Supplier shall ensure that the Goods shall:<br>
                    (a) correspond with their description and any applicable Goods Specification;<br>
                    (b) be of satisfactory quality (within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1979) and fit for any purpose held out by the Supplier or made known to the Supplier by PACCA, 
                    expressly or by implication, 
                    and in this respect PACCA relies on the Supplier’s skill and judgement;<br>
                (c) where they are manufactured products, be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship and remain so for 12 months after delivery; and<br>
                (d) comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture, labelling, packaging, storage, handling and delivery of the Goods.</p>

                <p>3.2 The Supplier shall ensure that at all times it has and maintains all the licences, permissions, authorisations, consents and permits that it needs to carry out its 
                    obligations under the Contract in 
                    respect of the Goods.</p>

                <p>3.3 PACCA may inspect and test the Goods at any time before delivery. The Supplier shall remain fully responsible for the Goods despite any such inspection or testing and any 
                    such inspection or testing 
                    shall not reduce or otherwise affect the Supplier’s obligations under the Contract.</p>

                <p>3.4 If following such inspection or testing PACCA considers that the Goods do not comply or are unlikely to comply with the Supplier’s undertakings at Clause 3.1, PACCA 
                    shall inform the Supplier and 
                    the Supplier shall immediately take such remedial action as is necessary to ensure compliance.</p>

                <p>3.5 PACCA may conduct further inspections and tests after the Supplier has carried out its remedial actions.</p>

            <!-- 4 -->
            <h3 id="four">4. Delivery of goods</h3>

                <p>4.1 The Supplier shall ensure that:<br>
                    (a) the Goods are properly packed and secured in such manner as to enable them to reach their destination in good condition;<br>
                    (b) each delivery of the Goods is accompanied by a delivery note which shows the date of the Order, the Order number (if any), the type and quantity of the
                    Goods (including the code number of the Goods 
                    (where applicable)), special storage instructions (if any) and, if the Goods are being delivered by instalments, the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered; and<br>
                    (c) it states clearly on the delivery note any requirement for PACCA to return any packaging material for the Goods to the Supplier. Any such packaging material shall only 
                    be returned to the Supplier at 
                    the cost of the Supplier.</p>

                <p>4.2 The Supplier shall deliver the Goods:<br>
                    (a) on the date specified in the Order or, if no such date is specified, then within 3 days of the date of the Order;<br>
                    (b) to such location as is set out in the Order or as instructed by PACCA before delivery (Delivery Location); and<br>
                    (c) during PACCA’s normal hours of business on a Business Day, or as instructed by PACCA.</p>

                <p>4.3 Delivery of the Goods shall be completed on the completion of unloading of the Goods at the Delivery Location.</p>

                <p>4.4 If the Supplier delivers more or less than the quantity of Goods ordered, PACCA shall be entitled to reject the goods or to accept the goods and reject any excess. If accepted, 
                    the Supplier shall make 
                    a pro rata adjustment to the invoice for the Goods. Any rejected Goods shall be returnable at the Supplier’s risk and expense.</p>

                <p>4.5 The Supplier shall not deliver the Goods in instalments without PACCA’s prior written consent. Where it is agreed that the Goods are delivered by instalments, they may 	be 
                    invoiced and paid for separately.
                    However, failure by the Supplier to deliver any one instalment on time or at all or any defect in an instalment shall entitle PACCA to the remedies set out in Clause 6.1.</p>

                <p>4.6 Title and risk in the Goods shall pass to PACCA on completion of delivery.</p>

                    (i) observe all health and safety rules and regulations and any other security requirements that apply at any of PACCA’s premises;<br>
                    (j) hold all materials, equipment and tools, drawings, specifications and data supplied by PACCA to the Supplier (PACCA Materials) in safe custody at its own risk,
