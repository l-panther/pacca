            <h3 id="three">The Information We Collect</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

                <p>
                    There are "special categories" of more sensitive personal data which requires a higher level of protection.
                    We may collect, store, and use the following categories of personal information and ‘special categories’ of personal information about you, including:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>photos, videos and testimonies.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 id="four">How Is Your Personal Information Collected</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We collect personal information about you through the application process, directly from you, your parents/guardians or other key workers.
                    We will also collect additional personal information through your participation of PACCA Out of School Club.
                </p>	

            <h3 id="five">What if I am applying on behalf of a young person?</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    Some parents, legal guardians or care workers apply on behalf of young people. If you are applying on behalf of a young person over the age of 13, you must obtain the young person’s consent for us to use their personal information in the way set out in this privacy policy. 
                </p>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We will draw the young person’s attention to how we are using their personal information as soon as we contact them and they will be entitled to withdraw the consent you gave.
                    However, as a parent, legal guardian or care worker, you may also be asked to give consent to our use of your personal information for the purposes explained below.
                </p>

            <h3 id="six">How will we use personal information we hold about you?</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you;</li>
                    <li>where we need to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
                    <li>where it is necessary for our legitimate interest;</li>
                    <li>where consent is provided; and</li>
                    <li>we may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:</li>
                    <li>where we need to protect your vital interests; and</li>
                    <li>where it is needed in the public interest. </li>
                </ul>

            <h3 id="seven">Situations in which we will use your personal information</h3>

                <p>
                    We need all the categories of information in the list above primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In some cases we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties, provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The situations in which we will process your information are listed below. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running and evaluating our services.</li>
                    <li>Informing you of other local opportunities.</li>
                    <li>To ensure you/your child are safe and supported whilst at the out of school club and allow us to comply with our legal obligations to keep the young people safe.</li>
                    <li>Administering the contract we have entered into with you.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 id="eight">If you fail to provide personal information</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    If you fail to provide personal information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you (such as assigning you a place at the Out of School 	Club), or you may be unable to continue with the programme e.g. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    if we are prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as ensuring the health and safety of the young 	people).
                </p>

            <h3 id="nine">Change of Purpose</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. 
                </p>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.	
                </p>

            <h3 id="ten">How we use sensitive information</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    "Special categories" of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection.
                </p>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We have in place an appropriate policy document and safeguards, which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    <li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.</li>
                    <li>Where we need to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with employment.</li>
                    <li>Where it is needed in the public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring</li>
                    <li>We may also process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public. We may also process such information about members or former members in the course of legitimate business activities with the appropriate safeguards.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom"> We will use your particularly sensitive personal information in the following ways: </p>
                <ul class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    <li>We will use information about your physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure your health and safety during the programme.</li>
                    <li>We will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations, act in the public interest, protection of your health or to reasonably exercise our rights. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.
                </p>

            <h3 id="eleven">Who might we share your personal information with?</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We may have to share your data with third parties including third-party service providers who are involved in the delivery of the programme.  We require third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law. In limited circumstances, we may transfer your personal information outside the EEA. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.
                </p>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    All our third-party service providers are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes, except that we may allow the use of photos for publicity, funding reports and programme updates. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Third parties" includes IT service providers, and other organisations that provide products or services to The Challenge and need the personal information to carry out the service or deliver the product. 
                </p>

            <h3 id="twelve">When will we delete the personal information?</h3>

                <p>
                    Unless there is a compelling safeguarding, health and safety, dispute or other legal reason to retain information for a longer period, we will normally delete:

                    Personally Identifiable Information means any information relating to a living individual (a “Data Subject”) where that Data Subject can be identified directly or indirectly, for example, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number or address. It includes “Special Category Information”. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Information which can be used to identify a ‘living individual’ e.g. name, address, email, address, date of birth, home address, phone number, identification number, location data, online data and include a Special Category Information.
                </p>

            <h3 id="thirteen">Will the personal information ever be stored or transferred outside the EEA?</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We may from time to time need to use the services of an IT provider that stores or accesses your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, we will only do so if there are appropriate safeguards to protect the information. For example, we will put in place European Commission model contractual clauses, ensure the supplier has binding corporate rules in place regarding data security and/or ensure the relevant country is recognise as having adequate data security by the European Commision.
                </p>

            <h3 id="fourteen">What rights might you have in relation to your personal information?</h3>

                    <li>request copies of personal information that we hold about you;</li>
                    <li>require inaccurate personal information to be corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete; and</li>
                    <li id="listNoBullet">in some circumstances:</li>
                    <li>request that your personal information is erased, for example, if its no longer necessary for the purpose we hold it for;</li>
                    <li>request that the use of your personal information is restricted, for example, where you have raised concerns as to the accuracy of the information;</li>
                    <li>object to our use of their personal information, for example, if the information being used for one of our legitimate interests like collection for evidence,  research, statistics;</li>
                    <li>withdraw consent to our use of your personal information going forward, for example, where you have requested support information but have changed your mind; and</li>
                    <li>have the personal information provided to us be transferred to another organisation.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    No fee is usually required.
                    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
                </p>

            <h3 id="fifthteen">What we may need from you</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
                    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).

                <p>
                    This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

            <h3 id="sixteen">Right to withdraw consent</h3>

                <p class="w3-padding-bottom">
